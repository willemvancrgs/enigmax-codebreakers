# enigmax-codebreakers
Scripts to expedite the process of breaking ciphers
## Contribution guidelines
- Unless popular decision overrules this, scripts and contributions should be made in python, seeing as this is the language most of us are familiar with
- Work on changes in a seperate branch before merging
- Each cipher should have its own python file/module to solve it, including a subroutine called `solve()` that takes ciphertext and any extra information as parametres, and then solves i
